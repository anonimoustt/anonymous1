# Introduction

In this research, we present a groundbreaking short text classification method for digital forensic analysis that effectively computes probability scores for target topics within a corpus of conversational texts. Unlike traditional state-of-the-art text classification methods, which depend on a trained model, extensive training data, human input, and a large corpus for efficient inference, our innovative approach operates independently of these constraints. We leverage the Sentence Transformer to generate high-quality embeddings and rigorously compare our model's performance with other embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec and Fast Text. Moreover, we evaluate our method against zero-shot and few-shot models. Our experiments involve two authoritative benchmarks: Daily Dialog {Lhoest_Datasets_A_Community_2021} and Dialog Sum {chen-etal-2021-dialogsum} data. The empirical results unequivocally demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional text classification techniques, confirming its effectiveness in this domain.
